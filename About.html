                    <p>Have you ever wanted to eat food but there was mold on it?
                    Have you ever had to quickly finish off a certain meal before 
                    mold grew on it? Then the Bacto-Stroyer X is the solution for
                    you. Our product is composed of two separate parts: a transmitter
                    and the emitters. The transmitter can receive input from the 
                    associated application. With this, the current status and 
                    functionality of the associated emitters can be easily and 
                    quickly altered by users of this product.
                    The emitter creates ultrasonic frequencies capable of 
                    interrupting cell division of bacterial and mold growth in a
                    small radius. The intended implementation of this feature is 
                    as an accessory device to any food storage unit. The inhibiting 
                    capabilities are intended to be beneficial to the preservation 
                    of food within these storage containers.
